# DCC Tabbed Character Sheet

This is a DCC sheet that uses tabs and Roll Templates.  It also includes a 0-level sheet, and a Monster sheet.  It is the same style sheet as the Mutant Crawl Classics (MCC) sheet.

## Current Version
1.4.3

#### 1.4.2

* Fixed display of crit table number (previously always rendered "II")

#### 1.4.1

#### 1.4

* Fixed bug where disapproval rolls with a negative luck modifier wouldn't roll
* Fixed unnamed rolls for Level 1+ Melee, Melee Backstab, Ranged, Ranged Backstab rolls so they can now be dragged onto the hotbar as macros
* Fixed unnamed rolls for Level 0 Melee and Ranged attack rolls so that they now can be dragged onto the hotbar as macros
* Fixed unnamed rolls for Monsters for Melee and Ranged attack rolls so that they now can be dragged onto the hotbar as macros

* Moved Arcane and Divine bonus/minus section from within the Roll Template to a field next to the spell check die.  This allows for people with a more permament mod to have to stop typing it in each time.  NOTE:  Do NOT include the bonus' from Lucky Rolls, Elvish Lucky Spells, Level, Spellburn, or Intelligence here as all of those values are added in elsewhere!

### Credit Where Credit is Due
The CSS and the layout of this sheet is an amalgamation of the work done by myself and ([@Actoba](https://app.roll20.net/users/427494/actoba) on roll20) on the 5e D&D sheet.
